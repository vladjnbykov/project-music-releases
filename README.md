# Music Releases done by Ulysses Veghelyi, Vladimir Bykov & Sari-Anne Peltola
This project was a music release site built on React in the framework of Technigo bootcamp. The page shows new album and single releases in Spotify. The project was done programming in pairs. 

## The problem
The hardest part was to use React to structure the page. We also had difficulties creating a hover effect on the icons while the album image should be darkened.
